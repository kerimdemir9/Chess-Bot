# Chess Bot
Chess Bot created with min-max + alpha-beta algortihm.
helper.py has the evaluation functions

As level gets higher, the amount of depth that is looked at min-max increases, thus the quality of the moves also increase. (Time it takes to move increases)
At level 5 you can play a game with little thinking time.
At level 7 it takes some time for the bot to play its move.
